Mass Effect Galaxy Map in Processing

This assignment is recreation of the Galaxy Map from the game Mass Effect.
In the game, the Galaxy Map is used to traverse the universe and is also used as a tool to learn about the various planets and species in the game's world.
While I could not implement the whole 'traversal' part of the galaxy map as it's not part of an overall game, I did try and recreate the feedback that the 
map gives you in-game with the various information tidbits about each planet.
